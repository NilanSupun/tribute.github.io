<h2>Here's a simple timeline of key events in the life of Albert Einstein:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>1879: Birth</h3>
    <p>Albert Einstein is born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>1884-1889: Early Education</h3>
    <p>Attends elementary school in Munich, Germany.
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>1896-1900: University Studies</h3>
    <p>Enrolls at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich (ETH Zurich) to study physics and mathematics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>1905: Annus Mirabilis Papers</h3>
    <p>In a single year, Einstein publishes four groundbreaking papers that revolutionize physics. These papers introduce concepts like the photoelectric effect, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy (E=mcÂ²).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>1907: Marriage and Family</h3>
    <p>Marries Mileva Maric, a fellow student at ETH Zurich. They have two sons, Hans Albert and Eduard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>1915: General Theory of Relativity</h3>
    <p>Publishes the complete formulation of the general theory of relativity, which describes the effects of gravity on the curvature of spacetime.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>1919: Eddington Expedition</h3>
    <p>Arthur Eddington's expedition confirms Einstein's prediction of light bending around the sun during a total solar eclipse, providing evidence for general relativity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>1921: Nobel Prize</h3>
    <p>Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the photoelectric effect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>1933: Emigration to the United States</h3>
    <p>Leaves Germany due to the rise of the Nazi regime and moves to the United States, where he accepts a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>1939: Letter to President Roosevelt</h3>
    <p>Writes a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt urging research into nuclear fission, a precursor to the development of the atomic bomb.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>1945: End of World War II</h3>
    <p>Witnessing the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Einstein becomes an advocate for nuclear disarmament.</p>
